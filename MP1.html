        <i><strong>Patrick Yacat</strong></i> is a 21-year-old computer
        engineering student at the University of the East - Manila. He is now in
        his third year on the program. He currently lives in Quezon City. He
        discovered his love for computers at a very young age, and started to
        gain an interest in the program. He also wants to be an engineer. Aside
        from that, the continuous innovations in technology inspired and drove
        him to choose computer engineering.

        My goal right now is to finish my education, get my degree in computer
        engineering, and get called an engineer. I also aspire to be a software
        developer or ethical hacking related to my program. Having a business
        someday is in my visions too. Lastly, I want to repay my parents for
        providing for me, and to have a comfortable life with my family in the
        future.
